Automated testing, automated fuzzing and automated harness creation have a long research history. Still, a lot of ground remains to be covered until true automation of these tasks is achieved. Until the introduction of transformers [@vaswani2023] and the 2020's boom of commercial GPTs [@chatgpt], automation regarding testing and fuzzing was mainly attempted through static and dynamic program analysis methods. These approaches are still utilized, but the fuzzing community has shifted almost entirely to researching the incorporation and employment of LLMs in the last half decade [@iris; @sun2024; @prophetfuzz; @oss-fuzz-gen; @green2022; @utopia; @fuzzgpt; @titanfuzz; @fuzzgen; @fudge]. The most significant and recent works in this field can be categorized according to their primary methodologies---whether they employ program analysis techniques or LLMs---and by the extent to which they depend on external resources beyond the source code. It is important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive.

## Static and Dynamic Analysis-Powered Fuzzing

These tools employ both dynamic and static analyses of source code, as well as LLMs to enhance the automated generation of effective fuzz drivers.

KLEE [@klee] is a seminal and widely cited symbolic execution engine introduced in 2008 by Cadar et al. It was designed to automatically generate high-coverage test cases for programs written in C, using symbolic execution to systematically explore the control flow of a program. KLEE operates on the LLVM [@llvm] bytecode representation of programs. Instead of executing a program on concrete inputs, KLEE performs symbolic execution---that is, it runs the program on symbolic inputs, which represent all possible values simultaneously. At each conditional branch, KLEE explores both paths by forking the execution and accumulating path constraints (i.e., logical conditions on input variables) along each path. This enables it to traverse many feasible execution paths in the program, including corner cases that may be difficult to reach through random testing or manual test creation. When an execution path reaches a terminal state (e.g., a program exit, an assertion failure, or a segmentation fault) KLEE uses a constraint solver to compute concrete input values that satisfy the accumulated constraints for that path. These values form a test case that will deterministically drive the program down that specific path when executed concretely.

IRIS [@iris] is a 2025 open-source neurosymbolic system for static vulnerability analysis. Given a codebase and a list of user-specified Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs), it analyzes source code to identify paths that may correspond to known vulnerability classes. IRIS combines symbolic analysis---such as control- and data-flow reasoning---with neural models trained to generalize over code patterns. It outputs candidate vulnerable paths along with explanations and CWE references. The system operates on full repositories and supports extensible CWE definitions.

IntelliGen [@zhang2021] is a system for automatically synthesizing fuzz drivers by statically identifying potentially vulnerable entry-point functions within C projects. Implemented using LLVM [@llvm], IntelliGen focuses on Improving fuzzing efficiency by targeting code more likely to contain memory safety issues, rather than exhaustively fuzzing all available functions. The system comprises of two main components: the *Entry Function Locator* and the *Fuzz Driver Synthesizer*. The Entry Function Locator analyzes the project's AST and classifies functions based on heuristics that indicate vulnerability. These include pointer dereferencing, calls to memory-related functions (e.g., `memcpy`, `memset`), and invocation of other internal functions. Functions that score highly on these metrics are prioritized for fuzz driver generation. The guiding insight is that entry points with fewer argument checks and more direct memory operations expose more useful program logic for fuzz testing. The Fuzz Driver Synthesizer then generates harnesses for these entry points. For each target function, it synthesizes an `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function that invokes the target with arguments derived from the fuzz input. This process involves inferring argument types from the source code and ensuring that runtime behavior does not violate memory safety---thus avoiding invalid inputs that would cause crashes unrelated to genuine bugs.

CKGFuzzer [@xu2024] is a fuzzing framework designed to automate the generation of effective fuzz drivers for C/C++ libraries by leveraging static analysis and LLMs. Its workflow begins by parsing the target project along with any associated library APIs to construct a code knowledge graph. This involves two primary steps: first, parsing the AST, and second, performing inter-procedural program analysis. Through this process, CKGFuzzer extracts essential program elements such as function signatures and implementations, and call relationships. Using the knowledge graph, CKGFuzzer then identifies and queries meaningful API combinations, focusing on those that are either frequently invoked together or exhibit functional similarity. It generates candidate fuzz drivers for these combinations and attempts to compile them. Any compilation errors encountered are automatically repaired using heuristics and domain knowledge. A dynamically updated knowledge base, constructed from prior library usage patterns, guides both the generation and repair processes. Once the drivers are successfully compiled, CKGFuzzer executes them while monitoring code coverage. It uses coverage feedback to iteratively mutate underperforming API combinations, refining them until new execution paths are discovered or a preset mutation budget is exhausted. Finally, any crashes triggered during fuzzing are subjected to a reasoning process based on chain-of-thought prompting [@chainofthought] (@sec-prompting). To help determine their severity and root cause, CKGFuzzer consults an LLM-generated knowledge base containing real-world examples of vulnerabilities mapped to known CWE entries.

## Extra Resources Required

The following works necessitate the presence of client code and/or unit tests that interact with the program's API. These works utilize and modify such existing code to create enhanced fuzzing harnesses.

FUDGE [@fudge] is a closed-source tool, made by Google, for automatic harness generation of C and C++ projects based on existing client code. It was used in conjunction with and in the improvement of Google's OSS-Fuzz [@oss-fuzz]. Being deployed inside Google's infrastructure, FUDGE continuously examines Google's internal code repository, searching for code that uses external libraries in a meaningful and "fuzzable" way (i.e. predominantly for parsing). If found, such code is *sliced* [@sasirekha2011Slicing] based on its Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) using LLVM's Clang tool [@llvm]. The above process results in a set of abstracted mostly-self-contained code snippets that make use of a library's calls and/or API. These snippets are later *synthesized* into the body of a fuzz driver, with variables being replaced and the fuzz input being utilized. Each is then injected in an `LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput` function and finalized as a fuzzing harness. A building and evaluation phase follows for each harness, where they are executed and examined. Every passing harness along with its evaluation results is stored in FUDGE's database, reachable to the user through a custom web-based UI.

UTopia [@utopia] (stylized [UTopia]{.smallcaps}) is an open-source automatic harness generation framework. Aside from the library code, It operates solely on user-provided unit tests since, according to Jeong et al. [@utopia], they are a resource of complete and correct API usage examples containing working library set-ups and tear-downs. Additionally, each of them are already close to a fuzz target, in the sense that they already examine a single and self-contained API usage pattern. Each generated harness follows the same data flow of the originating unit test. Static analysis is employed to figure out what fuzz input placement would yield the most results. It is also utilized in abstracting the tests away from the syntactical differences between testing frameworks, along with slicing and AST traversing using Clang.

Another project of Google is FuzzGen [@fuzzgen], this time open-source. Like FUDGE, it leverages existing client code of the target library to create fuzz targets for it. FuzzGen uses whole-system analysis, through which it creates an *Abstract API Dependence Graph* (A^2^DG). It uses the latter to automatically generate LibFuzzer-compatible harnesses. For FuzzGen to work, the user needs to provide both client code and/or tests for the API and the API library's source code as well. FuzzGen uses the client code to infer the *correct usage* of the API and not its general structure, in contrast to FUDGE. FuzzGen's workflow can be divided into three phases: *1. API usage inference*. By analyzing client code and tests, FuzzGen recognizes which functions belong to the library and learns its correct API usage patterns. This process is done with the help of Clang. To test if a function is actually a part of the library, a sample program is created and compiled. If the program compiles successfully, then the function is indeed a valid API call. *2. A^2^DG construction mechanism*. For all the existing API calls, FuzzGen builds an A^2^DG to record the API usages and infers its intended structure. After completion, this directed graph contains all the valid API call sequences found in the client code corpus. It is built in a two-step process: First, many smaller A^2^DGs are created, one for each root function per client code snippet. Once such graphs have been created for all the available client code instances, they are combined to formulate the master A^2^DG. *3. Fuzzer generator*. Through the A^2^DG, a fuzzing harness is created. Contrary to FUDGE, FuzzGen does not create multiple "simple" harnesses but a single complex one with the goal of covering the whole A^2^DG.

## Only Source Code Required

The approaches described in this section enable the creation of new fuzzing harnesses using exclusively the source code of the target library.

OSS-Fuzz [@ossfuzzdocs2025; @oss-fuzz] is a continuous, scalable and distributed cloud fuzzing solution for critical and prominent open-source projects. Developers of such software can submit their projects to OSS-Fuzz's platform, where its harnesses are built and constantly executed. This results in multiple bug findings that are later disclosed to the primary developers and are later patched. OSS-Fuzz started operating in 2016, an initiative in response to the Heartbleed vulnerability [@heartbleed-cve; @wheeler2014; @heartbleed]. Its hope is that through more extensive fuzzing such errors could be caught and corrected before having the chance to be exploited and thus disrupt the public digital infrastructure. So far, it has helped uncover over 10,000 security vulnerabilities and 36,000 bugs across more than 1,000 projects, significantly enhancing the quality and security of major software like Chrome, OpenSSL, and Systemd. A project that's part of OSS-Fuzz must have been configured as a ClusterFuzz [@clusterfuzz] project. ClusterFuzz is the fuzzing infrastructure that OSS-Fuzz uses under the hood and depends on Google Cloud Platform services, although it is possible to host it locally. Such an integration requires setting up a build pipeline, fuzzing jobs and expects a Google Developer account. Results are accessible through a web interface. ClusterFuzz, and by extension OSS-Fuzz, supports fuzzing through LibFuzzer, AFL++, Honggfuzz and FuzzTest---successor to Centipede--- with the last two being Google projects [@libfuzzer; @fuzztest; @honggfuzz; @aflpp]. C, C++, Rust, Go, Python and Java/JVM projects are supported.

OSS-Fuzz-Gen (OFG) [@liu2023; @oss-fuzz-gen] is Google's current state-of-the-art project regarding automatic harness generation through LLMs. It's purpose is to improve the fuzzing infrastructure of open-source projects that are already integrated into OSS-Fuzz. Given such a project, OSS-Fuzz-Gen uses its preexisting fuzzing harnesses and modifies them to produce new ones. Its architecture can be described as follows: 
1. With an OSS-Fuzz project's GitHub repository link, OSS-Fuzz-Gen iterates through a set of predefined build templates and generates potential build scripts for the project's harnesses. 
2. If any of them succeed they are once again compiled, this time through fuzz-introspector [@fuzz-introspector]. The latter constitutes a static analysis tool, with fuzzer developers specifically in mind. 
3. Build results, old harness and fuzz-introspector report are included in a template-generated prompt, through which an LLM is called to generate a new harness. 
4. The newly generated fuzz target is compiled and if it is done so successfully it begins execution inside OSS-Fuzz's infrastructure.
This method proves to be meaningful, with code coverage in fuzz campaigns increasing thanks to the new generated fuzz drivers. In the case of the tinyxml2 project [@thomason2025], line coverage went from 38% to 69% without any manual interventions [@liu2023].
In 2024, OSS-Fuzz-Gen introduced an experimental feature for generating harnesses in previously *unfuzzed* projects, meaning preexisting harnesses are no longer required [@oss-fuzzmaintainers2024]. Although this would be a step forwrard, this feature seems to have been abandonded. The code for this feature resides in the `experimental/from_scratch` directory of the project's GitHub repository [@oss-fuzz-gen], with the latest known working commit being `171aac2` and the latest overall commit being four months ago, as of this writing.

AutoGen [@sun2024] is a closed-source tool that generates new fuzzing harnesses, given only the library code and documentation. The user specifies the function for which a harness is to be generated. AutoGen gathers information for this function---such as the function body, used header files, function calling examples---from the source code and documentation^[Therefore, while no pre-existing client code is necessary, available documentation remains essential.]. Through specific prompt templates containing the above information, an LLM is tasked with generating a new fuzz driver, while another is tasked with generating a compilation command for said driver. If the compilation fails, both LLMs are called again to fix the problem, whether it was on the driver's or command's side. This loop iterates until a predefined maximum value or until a fuzz driver is successfully generated and compiled. If the latter is the case, it is then executed. If execution errors exist, the LLM responsible for the driver generation is used to correct them. If not, the pipeline has terminated and a new fuzz driver has been successfully generated.

## Differences With OverHAuL {#sec-differences}

OverHAuL differs, in some way, with each of the aforementioned works. Firstly, although KLEE and IRIS [@iris; @klee] tackle the problem of automated testing and both IRIS and OverHAuL can be considered neurosymbolic AI tools, the similarities end there. None of them utilize LLMs the same way we do---with KLEE not utilizing them at all, as it precedes them chronologically---and neither are automating any part of the fuzzing process.

When it comes to FUDGE, FuzzGen and UTopia [@utopia; @fuzzgen; @fudge], all three depend on and demand existing client code and/or unit tests. On the other hand, OverHAuL requires only the bare minimum: the library code itself. Another point of difference is that in contrast with OverHAuL, these tools operate in a linear fashion. No feedback is produced or used in any step and any point failure results in the termination of the entire run.

OverHAuL challenges a common principle of these tools, stated explicitly in FUDGE's paper [@fudge]: "Choosing a suitable fuzz target (still) requires a human". OverHAuL chooses to let the LLM, instead of the user, explore the available functions and choose one to target in its fuzz driver.

Both IntelliGen and CKGFuzzer [@zhang2021; @xu2024] depend primarily on programmatic analysis of the target projects---like type inference and knowledge graph construction, respectively. In contrast, OverHAuL delegates a greater portion of this analytical workload to LLM agents, leveraging their reasoning capabilities to achieve more accurate and reliable outcomes.

OSS-Fuzz-Gen [@oss-fuzz-gen] can be considered a close counterpart of OverHAuL, and in some ways it is. A lot of inspiration was gathered from it, like for example the inclusion of static analysis and its usage in informing the LLM. Yet, OSS-Fuzz-Gen has a number of disadvantages that make it in some cases an inferior option.
For one, OFG is tightly coupled with the OSS-Fuzz platform [@oss-fuzz], which even on its own creates a plethora of issues for the common developer. To integrate their project into OSS-Fuzz, they would need to: Transform it into a ClusterFuzz project [@clusterfuzz] and take time to write harnesses for it. Even if these prerequisites are carried out, it probably would not be enough. Per OSS-Fuzz's documentation [@ossfuzzdocs2025]: "To be accepted to OSS-Fuzz, an open-source project must have a significant user base and/or be critical to the global IT infrastructure". This means that OSS-Fuzz is a viable option only for a small minority of open-source developers and maintainers.
One countermeasure of the above shortcoming would be for a developer to run OSS-Fuzz-Gen locally. This unfortunately proves to be an arduous task. As it is not meant to be used standalone, OFG is not packaged in the form of a self-contained application. This makes it hard to setup and difficult to use interactively. Like in the case of FUDGE, OFG's actions are performed linearly. No feedback is utilized nor is there graceful error handling in the case of a step's failure. Even in the case of the experimental feature for bootstrapping unfuzzed projects, OFG's performance varies heavily. During experimentation, a lot of generated harnesses were still wrapped either in Markdown backticks or `<code>` tags, or were accompanied with explanations inside the generated `.c` source file. Even if code was formatted correctly, in many cases it missed necessary headers for compilation or used undeclared functions.

Lastly, the closest counterpart to OverHAuL is AutoGen [@sun2024]. Their similarity stands in the implementation of a feedback loop between LLM and generated harness. However, most other implementation decisions remain distinct. One difference regards the fuzzed function. While AutoGen requires a target function to be specified by the user in which it narrows during its whole run, OverHAuL delegates this to the LLM, letting it explore the codebase and decide by itself the best candidate. Another difference lies in the need---and the lack of---of documentation. While AutoGen requires it to gather information for the given function, OverHAuL leans into the role of a developer by reading the related code and comments and thus avoiding any mismatches between documentation and code. Finally, the LLMs' input is built based on predefined prompt templates, a technique also present in OSS-Fuzz-Gen. OverHAuL operates one abstraction level higher, leveraging DSPy [@dspy] for programming instead of prompting the LLMs used.

In conclusion, OverHAuL constitutes an *open-source* tool that offers new functionality by offering a straightforward installation process, packaged as a self-contained Python package with minimal external dependencies. It also introduces novel approaches compared to previous work by

1. Implementing a feedback mechanism between harness generation, compilation, and evaluation phases,
2. Using autonomous ReAct agents capable of codebase exploration,
3. Leveraging a vector store for code consumption and retrieval.
